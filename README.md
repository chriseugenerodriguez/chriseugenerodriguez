<br />

Iâ€™m a full-stack problem-solver forged in the front-end fire â€” what started as building UIs in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Angular pulled me deep into backend systems, DevOps, and app infrastructure. From leading teams to going solo-entrepreneur, Iâ€™ve worn almost every hat (except database design â€” too boring).
<br /><br />
I love tackling gnarly scaling problems, stabilizing messy systems, and helping teams ship faster, safer, and smarter.
<br /><br />
Outside the keyboard, Iâ€™m a foodie, social traveler (six countries and counting), and currently training for a triathlon â€” because balance is just another system worth optimizing.
<br /><br />
